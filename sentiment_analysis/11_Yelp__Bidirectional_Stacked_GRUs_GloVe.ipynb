    "Sequence prediction tasks require us to label each item of a sequence. Such tasks are common in natural language processing. Some examples include language modeling in which we predict the next word given a sequence of words at each step;\n",
    "part-of-speech tagging, in which we predict the grammatical part of speech for each word; named entity recognition, in which we predict whether each word is part of a named entity, such as Person, Location, Product, or Organization;\n",
    "and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, in NLP literature, the sequence prediction tasks are also referred to as sequence labeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although in theory we can use the **Vanilla/Elman recurrent neural networks for sequence prediction tasks, they fail to capture long-range dependencies well and perform poorly in practice**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the vanilla/Elman RNN is well suited for modeling sequences, it has two issues that make it unsuitable for many tasks: the **inability to retain information for long-range predictions, and gradient stability**.\n",
    "Recall that at their core, RNNs are computing a hidden state vector at each time step using the hidden state vector of the previous time step and an input vector at the current time step. It is this core computation that makes the RNN so powerful, but it also creates drastic numerical issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first issue with Elman RNNs is the **difficulty in retaining long-range information**. At each time step the RNN simply updates the hidden state vector regardless of whether it made sense. As a consequence, the RNN has no control over which values are retained and which are discarded in the hidden state—that is entirely determined by the input. Intuitively, that doesn’t make sense. What is desired is some way for the RNN to decide if the update is optional, or if the update happens, by how much and what parts of the state vector, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second issue with Elman RNNs is their tendency to cause **gradients to spiral out of control to zero or to infinity**. Unstable gradients that can spiral out of control are called either vanishing gradients or exploding gradients depending\n",
    "on the direction in which the absolute values of the gradients are shrinking/growing. A really large absolute value of the gradient or a really small (less than 1) value can make the optimization procedure unstable. There are solutions to deal with these gradient problems in vanilla RNNs, such as the use of rectified linear units (ReLUs), gradient clipping, and careful\n",
    "initialization. But none of the proposed solutions work as reliably as the technique called **gating**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gating as a Solution to a Vanilla RNN’s Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "To intuitively understand gating, suppose that you were adding two quantities, a and b, but you wanted to control how much of b gets into the sum.\n",
    "Mathematically, you can rewrite the sum a + b as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   **a + λb**\n",
    "\n",
    "where λ is a value between 0 and 1. If λ = 0, there is no contribution from b and if λ = 1, b contributes fully. Looking at it this way, you can interpret that λ acts as a “switch” or a “gate” in controlling the amount of b that gets into the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the intuition behind the gating mechanism. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s revisit the Elman RNN and see how gating can be incorporated into vanilla RNNs to make conditional updates. If the previous hidden state was h_t-1 and the current input is x_t, the recurrent update in the Elman RNN would look something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  **h_t = h_t-1 + F(h_t-1, x_t)**\n",
    "\n",
    "where F is the recurrent computation of the RNN. Obviously, **this is an unconditioned sum** and has the evils described earlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine if, instead of a constant, the λ in the previous example was a function of the previous hidden state vector h_t-1 and the current input x_t, and still produced the desired gating behavior; that is, a value between 0 and 1. With this gating function, our RNN update equation would appear as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  **h_t = h_t-1 + λ(h_t-1, x_t) F(h_t-1, x_t)**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Now it becomes clear that the function λ controls how much of the current input gets to update the state h_t-1. Further, the function λ is context-dependent. This is the basic intuition behind all gated networks. The function λ is usually a sigmoid\n",
    "function, which we know to produce a value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the **long short-term memory network (LSTM)** this basic intuition is extended carefully to incorporate not\n",
    "only conditional updates, but also intentional forgetting of the values in the previous hidden state h_t-1. This “forgetting” happens by multiplying the previous hidden state value h_t-1 with another function, μ, that also produces values\n",
    "between 0 and 1 and depends on the current input:\n",
    "\n",
    "  **h_t = μ(h_t-1, x_t) h_t-1 + λ(h_t-1, x_t) F(h_t-1, x_t)**\n",
    "  \n",
    "The LSTM is only one of the many gated variants of the RNN. Another variant that’s becoming increasingly popular is the **gated recurrent unit (GRU)**. Fortunately, in PyTorch, you can simply replace the nn.RNN or nn.RNNCell with nn.LSTM or nn.LSTMCell with no other code change to switch to an LSTM (mutatis mutandis for GRU)!\n",
    "\n",
    "The gating mechanism is an effective solution for Vanilla RNNs' problems seen earlier. It not only makes the updates controlled, but also keeps the gradient issues under check and makes training relatively easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word Vectors** are often used as a fundamental component for downstream NLP tasks, e.g. question answering, text generation, translation, etc., so it is important to build some intuitions as to their strengths and weaknesses. Here, you will explore word vectors derived via **GloVe**."

    "## Tips and Tricks for Training Sequence Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence models can be challenging to train, and many issues crop up in the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we summarize a few tips and tricks that we have found useful in our work, and that others have reported in the literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. When possible, use the gated variants**\n",
    "Gated architectures simplify training by addressing many of the numerical stability issues of nongated variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. When possible, prefer GRUs over LSTMs**\n",
    "GRUs provide almost comparable performance to LSTMs and use far fewer parameters and compute resources. Fortunately, from the point of view of PyTorch, using a GRU rather than an LSTM simply requires using a different Module class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Use Adam as your optimizer**\n",
    "We use only Adam as the optimizer, for good reason: it is reliable and typically converges faster than the alternatives.\n",
    "This is especially true for sequence models. If for some reason your models are not converging with Adam, switching to stochastic gradient descent might help.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Gradient clipping**\n",
    "If you notice numerical errors, instrument your code to plot the values of the gradients during training. After you know the range, clip any outliers. This will ensure smoother training. In PyTorch there is a helpful utility, **clip_grad_norm()**, to do this for you. In general, you should develop a habit of clipping gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Early stopping**\n",
    "With sequence models, it is easy to overfit. We recommend that you stop the training procedure early, when the evaluation error, as measured on a development set, starts going up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying gradient clipping in PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "In the training loop, after loss.backward():\n",

      "148888    OVERRATED. Took my girlfriend to watch the Lion King (LOVED IT) in December and we were so excited to try this place for brunch. After waiting an exhaustive period of time and watching hordes of people that came after us be seated before us, we confronted the host about it. They realized they totally screwed us so they immediately sat the 2 of us at a booth that could have easily sat around 6 people. OK, that's cool I guess...\\n\\nWhen my girlfriend asks our server if they have vanilla lattes he answers without any hesitation: \\\"no.\\\" A bus boy working in the vicinity over hears us and actually tells us that they do make those because he used to work the espresso bar (I guess he got demoted for knowing too much?!).  Whatever, we are still trying enjoy the experience... \\n\\nWe ended up ordering the Croque Madame, Corned Beef Hash, and some waffles. Croque Madame, ooh sounds fancy huh? Let me break it down for you: ham and cheese with egg on top. Sounds simple & delicious, well it should be UNLESS the bread is BURNT beyond edibility. After telling the waiter, he explains to us that's how the croque madame is supposed to be. We literally had to take one side of the bread and break it in front of him using both hands. Don't get me wrong, crispy/crunchy bread can be delicious, but this was not that. This was Wolverine-adamantium solid and burnt. The waiter then says to us, \\\"yea ok, that looks pretty burnt\\\"...\\n\\nWe then had a run-in with his manager. You would think at a high end establishment he would come to our table to let us know that we were being taken care of. No! Instead he tells that the bread might come out the same way. WTF?! Anyways, the next one comes and it's perfectly fine, go figure! Corned beef hash...sigh. Why do I always feel the need to order corned beef hash at a fancy place when I know Hormel corned beef hash is simply the best?! Waffles were good. We really wanted to like this place, trust me. In the end, this was an epic fail. Food sucked b*lls and the service was horrid. Not worth your time and money people...\n",
